/**
 * @class CommandPolicy
 * @brief Execution policy for command injection and execution during graph runtime
 *
 * CommandPolicy provides hooks for the dashboard to inject commands (start, stop, pause)
 * into the graph execution during runtime. Receives execution phase callbacks and can
 * trigger command processing at appropriate points in the execution lifecycle.
 *
 * Key responsibilities:
 * 1. **Initialization**: Set up command injection infrastructure
 * 2. **Phase Transitions**: Detect and respond to state changes
 * 3. **Command Processing**: Execute injected commands from dashboard
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 * - OnInit(): Prepare command processing (optional)
 * - OnStart(): Begin accepting commands (optional)
 * - OnStop(): Finish processing pending commands
 * - OnJoin(): Clean up after execution
 *
 * Integration Points:
 * - Dashboard sends commands to GraphExecutor
 * - GraphExecutor routes via policies during execution
 * - CommandPolicy hooks key transition points
 * - Policies can influence graph execution (pausing, stepping, etc.)
 *
