 * @file ThreadPool.hpp
 * @brief Centralized fixed-size thread pool with deterministic shutdown and deadlock detection
 *
 * @details
 * The ThreadPool provides a production-ready fixed-size pool of worker threads executing
 * user-supplied tasks from a shared FIFO queue. The design emphasizes:
 *
 * - **Explicit lifecycle management**: Construct → Init → Start → Stop → Join → Destroyed
 * - **Deterministic shutdown semantics**: No surprise task execution after Stop()
 * - **Deadlock detection**: Optional watchdog thread monitors long-running tasks
 * - **Safe task rejection**: Gracefully rejects tasks after shutdown is requested
 * - **Observable execution statistics**: Task counters, queue depth, timing metrics
 * - **Lock-free design**: Minimal lock contention via atomic operations and ActiveQueue
 *
 * ## Lifecycle Model
 *
 * The ThreadPool transitions through the following **strict, monotonic states**:
 *
 * ```
 * Constructed
 *     ↓
 * Init() called
 *     ↓
 * Started (Start() called, threads spawned)
 *     ↓
 * Stop() called (threads begin shutdown)
 *     ↓
 * Stopped (Join() completes, all threads exited)
 *     ↓
 * Destroyed (~ThreadPool guarantees all threads joined)
 * ```
 *
 * Calling state-specific methods outside their valid state is **undefined behavior**
 * unless explicitly documented as idempotent (e.g., Stop()).
 *
 * ## Thread Safety Model
 *
 * - **Task queuing**: Fully thread-safe (ActiveQueue handles synchronization)
 * - **Worker threads**: Execute tasks concurrently with independent stacks
 * - **Statistics updates**: Atomic operations ensure consistency
 * - **Shutdown coordination**: Lock-free via atomic flags where possible
 * - **Join semantics**: Condition variable for blocking until completion
 *
 * Multiple threads may safely call QueueTask() and QueueTaskWithTimeout() concurrently.
 * Only the owning thread should call Init(), Start(), Stop(), and Join().
 *
 * ## Deadlock Detection System
 *
 * An optional watchdog thread monitors task execution time:
 *
 * 1. **Timing**: Each task's start time is recorded atomically
 * 2. **Monitoring**: Watchdog checks every watchdog_interval ms
 * 3. **Detection**: If any task exceeds task_timeout, deadlock_detected_ is set
 * 4. **Action**: Detection is **advisory** - execution is NOT interrupted
 * 5. **Recovery**: Call ClearDeadlockFlag() after investigation
 *
 * Useful for:
 * - Long-running or compute-intensive tasks
 * - Identifying tasks that unexpectedly block
 * - Monitoring system health and responsiveness
 *
 * ## Shutdown Guarantees
 *
 * Once Stop() is called:
 * - **No new tasks start**: Pending tasks are enqueued but not executed
 * - **Active tasks complete**: Already-running tasks finish normally
 * - **Queue drains**: Remaining queued tasks are discarded without execution
 * - **Threads exit**: All worker threads reach end-of-loop and terminate
 * - **Watchdog stops**: Optional watchdog thread also terminates
 *
 * The destructor **guarantees** no joinable threads remain after completion.
 *
 * ## Performance Characteristics
 *
 * - **Queue Operations**: O(1) lock-free enqueue/dequeue (ActiveQueue)
 * - **Task Startup Latency**: ~100-500 microseconds (platform dependent)
 * - **Context Switch Overhead**: Standard OS thread scheduling
 * - **Memory**: Fixed allocation at construction (no dynamic reallocation)
 * - **Scalability**: Scales to CPU core count; beyond that, contention increases
 *
 * ## Usage Patterns
 *
 * ### Basic Usage
 * @code
 *   ThreadPool pool(4);  // 4 worker threads
 *   pool.Init();
 *   pool.Start();
 *   
 *   // Queue work
 *   for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
 *       pool.QueueTask([i] { std::cout << "Task " << i << std::endl; });
 *   }
 *   
 *   // Shutdown
 *   pool.Stop();
 *   pool.Join();  // Wait for completion
 * @endcode
 *
 * ### With Configuration
 * @code
 *   ThreadPool::DeadlockConfig cfg;
 *   cfg.task_timeout = std::chrono::milliseconds(1000);
 *   cfg.watchdog_interval = std::chrono::milliseconds(500);
 *   cfg.max_queue_size = 5000;
 *   cfg.enable_detection = true;
 *   
 *   ThreadPool pool(4, cfg);
 *   pool.Init();
 *   pool.Start();
 * @endcode
 *
 * ### With Timeout
 * @code
 *   auto result = pool.QueueTaskWithTimeout(
 *       task,
 *       std::chrono::milliseconds(100)
 *   );
 *   if (result == ThreadPool::QueueResult::Ok) {
 *       // Successfully queued
 *   } else if (result == ThreadPool::QueueResult::Timeout) {
 *       // Queue full, timed out waiting
 *   } else if (result == ThreadPool::QueueResult::Stopped) {
 *       // Pool is shutting down
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 * ## Design Decisions
 *
 * **Why Fixed-Size?**
 * Deterministic resource allocation and predictable behavior.
 * Dynamic resizing adds complexity and can cause cascading thread creation.
 *
 * **Why No Task Cancellation?**
 * Once started, tasks must complete. This simplifies correctness guarantees
 * and avoids resource cleanup issues.
 *
 * **Why ActiveQueue?**
 * Lock-free queuing minimizes contention and provides deterministic
 * performance without mutex-induced priority inversion.
 *
 * **Why No Return Values?**
 * Tasks return void by design. Use external synchronized data structures
 * for result aggregation (channels, atomic variables, synchronized maps).
 *
 * ## Atomic Operation Guarantees
 *
 * All operations use standard C++11 atomics with appropriate memory ordering:
 * - **memory_order_relaxed**: Statistics and flags (no ordering needed)
 * - **memory_order_acquire/release**: State transitions (synchronization points)
 * - **memory_order_seq_cst**: Stop/join coordination (strongest guarantee)

/**
 * @brief Execution statistics for the thread pool
 *
 * All fields are atomically updated and may be queried concurrently
 * without locks. Statistics are monotonically increasing over the lifetime
 * of the pool and never reset during operation (use destructor + reconstruction
 * for a fresh pool with reset statistics).
 *
 * ## Fields
 *
 * ### Task Counters
 *
 * **tasks_queued**: Total number of QueueTask() or QueueTaskWithTimeout() calls
 * that returned QueueResult::Ok. Incremented before the task enters the queue.
 *
 * **tasks_completed**: Successfully executed tasks that returned normally
 * (no exception thrown). Incremented in ExecuteTask() after completion.
 *
 * **tasks_failed**: Tasks that threw uncaught exceptions. Incremented in
 * ExecuteTask() when std::exception_ptr is caught.
 *
 * **tasks_rejected**: Tasks rejected without queuing (pool stopped or queue full).
 * Incremented when QueueTask() returns QueueResult::Stopped or QueueResult::Full.
 *
 * Relationship:
 * ```
 * tasks_queued + tasks_rejected = total enqueue attempts
 * tasks_completed + tasks_failed = tasks_queued
 * ```
 *
 * ### Queue Metrics
 *
 * **peak_queue_size**: Maximum observed number of pending tasks at any point.
 * Useful for tuning max_queue_size configuration.
 *
 * ### Timing Metrics
 *
 * **total_task_time_ns**: Sum of all individual task execution times in nanoseconds.
 * Accurate to the precision of std::chrono::high_resolution_clock.
 * Use GetAverageTaskTimeMs() to derive the average.
 *
 * Overflow note: At 1 microsecond per task (1000 ns), overflow occurs after
 * approximately 584 years of continuous operation. For most applications,
 * this is a non-issue, but systems with extreme uptimes should periodically
 * reset the pool.
 *
 * ### Deadlock Detection
 *
 * **deadlock_detections**: Number of times the watchdog thread detected a
 * task exceeding task_timeout. This is an advisory metric; the task is NOT
 * forcibly terminated. Use to identify potential issues or tune task_timeout.
 *
 * **enqueue_timeouts**: Number of QueueTaskWithTimeout() calls that timed out
 * waiting for queue capacity. Indicates queue congestion during the attempted
 * enqueue.
 *
 * ## Thread Safety
 *
 * All fields use std::atomic<T> with appropriate memory ordering:
 * - Relaxed ordering for statistics (no inter-thread synchronization needed)
 * - Acquire/release for state transitions (synchronization point)
 *
 * Safe to read from multiple threads concurrently without GetStats() needing
 * a lock. Consider snapshot semantics: simultaneous reads may observe a
 * partially-updated state if threads are actively updating stats.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * @code
 *   auto& stats = pool.GetStats();
 *   std::cout << "Completed: " << stats.tasks_completed << std::endl;
 *   std::cout << "Failed: " << stats.tasks_failed << std::endl;
 *   std::cout << "Avg time: " << pool.GetAverageTaskTimeMs() << " ms" << std::endl;
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note Overflow Handling: Integer overflow is silent (wrapping). For
 * production monitoring, either reset periodically or use saturating counters
 * (not currently implemented).
 *
 * @see ThreadPool::GetStats() for access
 * @see ThreadPool::GetAverageTaskTimeMs() for derived metric

/**
 * @brief Fixed-size thread pool with explicit lifecycle control and deadlock detection
 *
 * The ThreadPool manages a fixed number of worker threads that dequeue and
 * execute tasks from a shared thread-safe work queue. It is designed for
 * applications requiring:
 *
 * - Deterministic shutdown semantics
 * - Observable execution metrics
 * - Optional deadlock/long-task detection
 * - Lock-free task queuing
 * - FIFO task execution order
 *
 * ## Core Properties
 *
 * - **Fixed thread count**: Specified at construction, never changes
 * - **FIFO ordering**: Tasks execute in enqueue order
 * - **Explicit lifecycle**: Init() → Start() → Stop() → Join()
 * - **No task cancellation**: Once started, tasks run to completion
 * - **Graceful shutdown**: Active tasks complete, pending tasks discarded
 * - **Optional watchdog**: Monitors long-running tasks for diagnostics
 *
 * ## Call Sequence Diagram
 *
 * ```
 * ThreadPool pool(num_threads);   // Constructed, no threads yet
 *
 * pool.Init();                     // Initialize (still no threads)
 * pool.Start();                    // ← Threads spawned here
 *
 * pool.QueueTask(work);            // (can be called from any thread)
 * pool.QueueTask(work);            // (can be called from any thread)
 *
 * pool.Stop();                     // Request shutdown (idempotent)
 * pool.Join();                     // ← Blocks until all threads exit
 *
 * // pool destroyed automatically (destructor guarantees Join)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Invariants & Guarantees
 *
 * **Execution**: Tasks never execute after Stop() is called
 *
 * **Threads**: Each worker thread exits exactly once; destructor guarantees
 * no joinable threads remain
 *
 * **Queue**: FIFO discipline maintained; task order is preserved
 *
 * **Statistics**: All counters and metrics are atomic and safe for concurrent access
 *
 * **Exception handling**: Tasks throwing exceptions are logged but do not affect
 * other tasks or pool operation
 *
 * ## State Machine
 *
 * ```
 * [Constructed] --Init()--→ [Initialized] --Start()--→ [Started]
 *                                                           ↓
 *                                                       Stop()
 *                                                           ↓
 *                                                      [Stopping]
 *                                                           ↓
 *                                                      Join()
 *                                                           ↓
 *                                                      [Stopped]
 * ```
 *
 * Only the owning thread should drive state transitions.
 * Multiple threads may safely call QueueTask() and GetStats().
 *
 * ## Task Execution Model
 *
 * Each worker thread runs the following loop:
 *
 * ```cpp
 * while (!stop_requested_) {
 *     Task task;
 *     if (task_queue_.Dequeue(task)) {  // Blocking dequeue with timeout
 *         ExecuteTask(task);            // Execute with timing/exception handling
 *         stats.tasks_completed++;
 *     }
 * }
 * // Thread exits
 * ```
 *
 * ## Deadlock Detection Strategy
 *
 * Optional watchdog thread monitors in parallel:
 *
 * 1. **Snapshot**: Record task start time and count
 * 2. **Sleep**: Wait for watchdog_interval milliseconds
 * 3. **Check**: If same task still running, check elapsed time
 * 4. **Detect**: If elapsed > task_timeout, set deadlock_detected_ flag
 * 5. **Report**: Log warning but continue (no forcible termination)
 * 6. **Clear**: Application calls ClearDeadlockFlag() after investigation
 *
 * This is a **best-effort advisory system**, not a guarantee of termination.
 *
 * ## Memory Management
 *
 * - **Stack space**: One stack per worker thread (~8-16 MB on typical systems)
 * - **Queue buffers**: Allocated at construction time; no dynamic growth
 * - **Exceptions**: std::exception_ptr is copied into exception_list
 * - **Atomic variables**: Zero-overhead abstractions (typically single CPU cache line)
 *
 * ## Performance Tips
 *
 * 1. **Queue sizing**: Set max_queue_size >= peak_queue_depth. Monitor peak_queue_size stat.
 * 2. **Task granularity**: Tasks should be 1-100 ms for best throughput
 * 3. **Watchdog tuning**: Set task_timeout to 2-3x the expected maximum task time
 * 4. **Thread count**: Use hardware concurrency for I/O-bound work, fewer for CPU-bound
 * 5. **Lock-free**: Avoid locks inside tasks; use atomic variables for coordination
 *
 * ## Exception Handling
 *
 * Tasks that throw are caught, logged, and counted. The exception does NOT:
 * - Propagate to the caller
 * - Terminate the worker thread
 * - Affect other tasks
 * - Stop the pool
 *
 * Use a wrapper lambda if task-level exception recovery is needed.
 *

    /**
     * @brief Configuration for deadlock detection and queue behavior
     *
     * ## Fields
     *
     * **task_timeout**: Maximum allowed time for a single task to execute.
     * If any task exceeds this duration, the watchdog sets deadlock_detected_ flag.
     * Default: 5000 ms (5 seconds). Recommended: 2-3x expected maximum task time.
     *
     * **watchdog_interval**: How often the watchdog thread wakes up to check
     * task execution times. Smaller values provide faster detection but higher
     * CPU overhead. Default: 1000 ms. Recommended: task_timeout / 10.
     *
     * **max_queue_size**: Maximum number of pending (not yet executed) tasks
     * allowed in the queue. QueueTask() returns Full if this would be exceeded.
     * Default: 1000. Tune based on peak_queue_size metric.
     *
     * **enable_detection**: When true, spawns watchdog thread. When false,
     * watchdog thread is not created and timeout-based checks do not run.
     * Reduces CPU overhead if deadlock detection is not needed.
     * Default: true. Set to false for known short-duration tasks.
     *
     * ## Tuning Guide
     *
     * ### Detecting Stalls
     * Set task_timeout slightly above the 99th percentile of task duration.
     * Too low: False positives (normal variance triggers detection)
     * Too high: Late detection of actual stalls
     *
     * ### Queue Capacity
     * Monitor peak_queue_size from ThreadPoolStats. Set max_queue_size 20-30%
     * higher to provide buffer for bursts. Too low causes task rejection.
     *
     * ### Watchdog Overhead
     * Default watchdog_interval of 1000ms checks once per second. For
     * latency-sensitive applications, reduce to 100-500ms for faster detection.
     * For batch workloads, increase to 5000ms+ to reduce polling overhead.
     *

     *

     * ## Implicit Shutdown
     *
     * If the pool is destroyed while in Started state:

     * - All threads are joined

     * ## Usage

     *   pool->Init();
     *   pool->Start();
     *   pool->QueueTask([]{ \/\/ work });
     *   pool->Stop();

     *
     * ## What It Does
     * - Validates configuration
     * - Allocates internal structures (queue, condition variables)
     * - Reserves space for thread objects
     * - Does NOT spawn any threads
     *
     * ## When to Call
     * Must be called in the Constructed state, before Start().
     *
     * ## Valid State Transitions
     * Constructed → Init() → Initialized
     *

     *
     * Spawns all configured worker threads and optionally the watchdog thread.
     * The pool transitions from Initialized to Started and begins accepting tasks.
     *
     * ## What It Does
     * 1. Marks pool as running (running_ = true)
     * 2. Spawns worker threads equal to num_threads_
     * 3. Each worker thread starts WorkerMain() loop
     * 4. Spawns watchdog thread if enable_detection=true
     * 5. Watchdog starts WatchdogMain() monitoring loop
     *
     * ## Thread Creation
     * - One thread per configured num_threads value
     * - Each thread independently dequeues and executes tasks
     * - Threads have independent stacks (~8-16 MB each)
     * - No shared stack between worker threads

     * - Idempotent: Safe to call multiple times
     * - Atomic: stop_requested_ flag update is atomic

     *
     * ## After Stop()
     * - No new tasks will start (existing tasks continue)
     * - QueueTask() returns QueueResult::Stopped
     * - Worker threads wake up and check stop_requested_
     * - Threads exit gracefully after current task finishes
     *
     * ## Valid State Transitions
     * Started → Stop() → Stopping
     *
     * @pre Pool should be in Started state (can call at any time)
     * @post stop_requested_ = true
     * @post task_queue is disabled (Dequeue returns empty after queue drained)
     * @note Thread-safe: Can be called from any thread
     * @note Non-blocking: Returns immediately, does not wait
     *
     * ## Example: Graceful Shutdown
     *
     * @code
     *   pool.QueueTask([]{ std::cout << "Task 1" << std::endl; });
     *   pool.QueueTask([]{ std::cout << "Task 2" << std::endl; });

     *
     * ## Synchronization Model
     * - Uses condition variable (join_cv_) for efficient waiting
     * - Threads notify join_cv_ when they decrement live_workers_ to zero
     * - Main thread awakens and returns when count reaches zero
     *
     * ## Valid State Transitions

     * @note Thread-safe: Only owning thread should call
     * @note Blocking: Does not return until shutdown completes
     *
     * ## What Happens
     * 1. Call Stop() first (if not done) to request shutdown
     * 2. Call Join() - blocks on condition variable
     * 3. Workers notice stop_requested_ and finish cleanup
     * 4. Last worker decrements live_workers_ to zero
     * 5. Last worker notifies join_cv_
     * 6. Join() unblocks and returns
     *
     * ## Example
     *
     * @code
     *   ThreadPool pool(4);
     *   pool.Init();
     *   pool.Start();
     *

     *
     * ## Return Value Semantics

     * ## Usage Examples
     *
     * ### Graceful Timeout
     * @code

     *       std::cout << "Shutdown complete" << std::endl;

     *       // Threads still running after 5 seconds
     *       // Destructor will still Join() (blocks indefinitely)
     *   }
     * @endcode
     *
     * ### Retry Pattern
     * @code
     *   pool.Stop();
     *
     *   for (int attempt = 0; attempt < 3; ++attempt) {
     *       if (pool.JoinWithTimeout(std::chrono::seconds(10))) {
     *           std::cout << "Shutdown succeeded" << std::endl;

     *       std::cout << "Attempt " << attempt << " timed out, retrying..." << std::endl;
     *   }
     * @endcode
     *
     * ## Implementation Detail
     *
     * Uses condition_variable::wait_until() with std::chrono::steady_clock

     * @post If returned true: all threads exited (same as Join())
     * @post If returned false: threads may still be running

     * @note Blocking: Blocks for up to timeout duration
     *
     * @see Join() for indefinite waiting

    [[nodiscard]] bool JoinWithTimeout(std::chrono::milliseconds timeout) noexcept;

    /**
     * @brief Queue a task for immediate (non-blocking) execution
     *
     * Attempts to add a task to the work queue without blocking.

     *
     * ## Return Values
     *
     * **QueueResult::Ok**: Task successfully enqueued and will be executed.
     * The task is guaranteed to execute before pool destruction, subject to
     * active task completion (not pending task execution after Stop()).
     *
     * **QueueResult::Stopped**: Pool has been shut down (stop_requested_ = true).
     * Task rejected; it will never execute. Try again after pool restart (if supported).
     *
     * **QueueResult::Full**: Queue is at capacity (size >= max_queue_size).
     * Task rejected due to congestion. Consider:
     * - Use QueueTaskWithTimeout() to wait for capacity
     * - Increase max_queue_size in DeadlockConfig
     * - Increase number of worker threads
     *
     * **QueueResult::Error**: Unexpected internal error (rare).
     * Indicates serious issue with queue operation.
     *
     * **QueueResult::Timeout**: Unused by QueueTask(); always returns Ok/Stopped/Full/Error.
     *
     * ## Task Semantics
     *
     * Queued tasks:
     * - Execute in FIFO order (enqueue order preserved)
     * - Execute exactly once or never (if Stop() discards pending tasks)
     * - Execute from worker thread context (not main thread)
     * - Share no stack with other tasks (independent stacks)
     * - Cannot be cancelled once queued
     * - May throw exceptions (caught and logged)
     *
     * ## Thread Safety
     *
     * Fully thread-safe: Multiple threads may call QueueTask() concurrently.
     * No locks needed due to ActiveQueue's lock-free implementation.
     *
     * ## Statistics Update
     *
     * On success (Ok return):
     * - tasks_queued is incremented
     * - peak_queue_size may be updated
     * - Other stats unchanged until task executes
     *
     * On failure (any non-Ok return):
     * - tasks_rejected is incremented
     * - tasks_queued is NOT incremented
     * - Task never enters the work queue
     *
     * ## Example Usage

     * duration. If capacity becomes available within the timeout, task is queued.
     * If timeout expires, task is rejected.
     *
     * ## Return Values
     *
     * **QueueResult::Ok**: Task successfully enqueued. Returned immediately
     * when queue has capacity (didn't wait) or capacity became available during wait.
     *
     * **QueueResult::Timeout**: Timeout expired before queue capacity available.

     *
     * ## Timing Behavior
     *
     * The timeout is measured from the call time using steady_clock,
     * ensuring accuracy regardless of system clock adjustments.
     *
     * The timeout is for the **waiting period only**. The timeout does NOT:
     * - Include time spent in task execution (that happens later)
     * - Include time spent queueing the task (negligible, lock-free)
     * - Limit task execution duration (use deadlock detection for that)
     *
     * ## Blocking Semantics
     *
     * This call blocks the **caller's thread** (not a worker thread) while
     * waiting for queue capacity. If called from the main thread:
     * - Main thread blocks in this method
     * - Worker threads continue executing tasks
     * - When capacity available or timeout expires, main thread unblocks
     *
     * ## Comparison with QueueTask
     *
     * | Method | Blocks | When to Use |
     * |--------|--------|------------|
     * | QueueTask() | No | Best-effort, task not critical |
     * | QueueTaskWithTimeout() | Yes, up to timeout | Guaranteed delivery or error |
     *
     * ## Example: Guaranteed Task Delivery

     *       std::cerr << "Pool shutting down" << std::endl;
     *   }
     * @endcode
     *

     *
     * ## Semantics
     *
     * - Fixed at construction time (no dynamic resizing)

     *
     * ## Available Metrics
     *
     * - **tasks_queued**: Total successfully enqueued

     * 2. Waiting a brief period for ongoing tasks to complete
     * 3. Then reading GetStats()
     *
     * ## Usage Examples
     *
     * ### Simple Stats Dump
     * @code
     *   auto& stats = pool.GetStats();

     *   std::cout << "Peak queue: " << stats.peak_queue_size << "\n";
     * @endcode
     *
     * ### Health Check
     * @code
     *   auto& stats = pool.GetStats();
     *   if (stats.tasks_failed > 0) {
     *       std::cerr << "Some tasks failed!" << std::endl;
     *   }
     *   if (stats.deadlock_detections > 0) {
     *       std::cerr << "Potential deadlock detected" << std::endl;

     * ### Performance Monitoring
     * @code

     *   double avg_time_ms = pool.GetAverageTaskTimeMs();
     *   double throughput = stats.tasks_completed / elapsed_seconds;

    /**
     * @brief Get average task execution time in milliseconds
     *
     * Calculates average execution time per task by dividing cumulative
     * task execution time by the number of completed tasks.
     *
     * **Formula**: total_task_time_ns / tasks_completed / 1,000,000
     *
     * ## Return Value
     *
     * - **>0.0**: Average time in milliseconds (typical case)
     * - **0.0**: No tasks have completed yet (divide-by-zero protection)
     * - **Very small**: Tasks complete in < 1 microsecond (rare)
     *
     * ## Interpretation
     *
     * | Result | Meaning |
     * |--------|---------|
     * | 0.1 ms | Very fast tasks (network acks, cache hits) |
     * | 1-10 ms | Typical I/O operations |
     * | 10-100 ms | Longer I/O, light computation |
     * | 100+ ms | Heavy computation or blocking I/O |
     *
     * Excessively long average times may indicate:
     * - Tasks blocking on locks/I/O
     * - Insufficient worker threads (queue stalling)
     * - Deadlock/stalled tasks (check deadlock_detections)
     * - Task granularity too coarse
     *
     * ## Example: Detecting Performance Regression
     *
     * @code
     *   double baseline_avg = 5.0;  // Expected avg task time
     *   double current_avg = pool.GetAverageTaskTimeMs();
     *   double degradation = (current_avg - baseline_avg) / baseline_avg * 100;
     *
     *   if (degradation > 50.0) {  // 50% slower
     *       std::cerr << "Performance degradation detected: " 
     *                  << degradation << "%" << std::endl;
     *       std::cerr << "Check for system load or task complexity increase" 
     *                  << std::endl;
     *   }
     * @endcode
     *
     * ## Precision Note
     *
     * Measured in nanoseconds internally, converted to milliseconds.
     * Precision is approximately 1 microsecond due to steady_clock resolution
     * and typical OS timer granularity.
     *
     * @return Average task time in milliseconds

    /**
     * @brief Check if the watchdog detected a potential deadlock condition
     *
     * Returns true if the watchdog thread observed any task exceeding
     * the configured task_timeout duration. This is an **advisory flag**
     * indicating potential issues, not a guarantee that a true deadlock occurred.
     *
     * ## Semantics
     *
     * - Set to true when watchdog detects task_timeout exceeded
     * - Remains true until explicitly cleared via ClearDeadlockFlag()
     * - Never automatically cleared (advisory, non-intrusive)
     * - Only meaningful if enable_detection=true in DeadlockConfig
     *
     * ## Important Caveats
     *
     * **NOT a deadlock**: The name is slightly misleading. A deadlock in the
     * strict OS sense requires circular wait conditions. This flag indicates
     * **long task execution**, which may be intentional (background work,
     * heavy I/O, legitimate computation).
     *
     * **False positives**: High system load, GC pauses, or task bursts can
     * cause transient timeouts that don't indicate real problems.
     *
     * **Not forcibly stopped**: Detecting a timeout does NOT interrupt the task.
     * The task continues running. This is intentional to avoid partial resource
     * cleanup and data corruption.
     *
     * ## When to Investigate
     *
     * - High deadlock_detections count in GetStats()
     * - Performance degradation coinciding with detections
     * - Consistent timeouts (not transient)
     * - Correlation with system overload
     *
     * ## Recovery Strategies
     *
     * 1. **Increase task_timeout**: If tasks legitimately take longer
     * 2. **Add worker threads**: If queue is growing (task starvation)
     * 3. **Reduce task granularity**: Break long tasks into smaller chunks
     * 4. **Optimize tasks**: Profile to identify blocking operations
     * 5. **Scale hardware**: If CPU-bound, add cores; if I/O-bound, add bandwidth
     *
     * ## Example: Monitoring with Alerts
     *
     * @code
     *   // In monitoring loop
     *   if (pool.IsDeadlockDetected()) {
     *       auto& stats = pool.GetStats();
     *       std::cerr << "Deadlock flag set! Detections: " 
     *                  << stats.deadlock_detections << std::endl;
     *
     *       // Optional: Increase timeout and retry
     *       auto cfg = pool.GetConfig();
     *       cfg.task_timeout *= 2;
     *       pool.SetConfig(cfg);
     *       pool.ClearDeadlockFlag();
     *
     *       std::cout << "Configuration updated, retrying..." << std::endl;

     * ## Usage Model
     *
     * Intended workflow:
     * 1. Monitoring code checks IsDeadlockDetected() and finds it true
     * 2. Operator/script investigates the condition
     * 3. Implements recovery (increase timeout, add threads, optimize tasks)
     * 4. Calls ClearDeadlockFlag() to reset for next monitoring period
     * 5. Continues operation with improved configuration
     *
     * ## When to Call
     *
     * - After adjusting DeadlockConfig (timeouts, intervals)
     * - After identifying that detections were false positives
     * - After optimization that addresses the root cause
     * - Before restarting a pool instance
     * - Periodically in long-running applications (e.g., every hour)
