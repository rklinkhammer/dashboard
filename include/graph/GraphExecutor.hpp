/**
 * @class GraphExecutor
 * @brief Orchestrates execution of a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
 *
 * GraphExecutor is the main engine for executing computational graphs, coordinating
 * node execution, managing state transitions, and publishing metrics through
 * capabilities (MetricsCapability, GraphCapability).
 *
 * Execution States:
 * - **STOPPED**: Not executing, ready to start
 * - **INITIALIZING**: Running Init() to prepare nodes
 * - **RUNNING**: Active execution of graph nodes
 * - **PAUSED**: Suspended execution (nodes retain state)
 * - **STOPPING**: Graceful shutdown in progress
 *
 * Execution Flow:
 * 1. Init() → Initialize graph and nodes
 * 2. Start() → Begin execution
 * 3. Run() → Execute nodes (blocking)
 * 4. Stop() → Request graceful shutdown
 * 5. Join() → Wait for completion
 *
 * Policies:
 * The executor uses an ExecutionPolicyChain to customize behavior:
 * - MetricsPolicy: Publishes metrics updates
 * - CompletionPolicy: Detects when execution is complete
 * - CommandPolicy: Handles external commands
 * - Other policies can inject data or modify behavior
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 * - Init(), Start(), Stop(), Join() are not thread-safe for concurrent calls
 * - State queries (IsRunning(), GetState()) are thread-safe
 * - Policies may run in executor threads and must handle synchronization
 *
 * @see ExecutionPolicyChain, IExecutionPolicy
 * @see MetricsCapability, GraphCapability
 *
 * @example
 *   auto graph = std::make_shared<GraphManager>();
 *   // ... configure graph ...
 *   
 *   auto executor = std::make_unique<GraphExecutor>(policies);
 *   executor->Init();
 *   executor->Start();
 *   
 *   // Run blocking execution
 *   auto result = executor->Run();
 *   
 *   executor->Stop();
 *   executor->Join();
